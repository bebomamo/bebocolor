# bebocolor README

/*
    Hi, I'm Ben Malone, a computer engineering student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign(UIUC).

/*
    I made this custom color theme for two reasons: 1. I wanted to make one because I like customizing my things and making them personal, and 2. I thought all the standard VsCode themes were either not enough coloring or way too much.
*/

/*
    My Theme is designed to feel well-colored like the standard color themes(like c'mon its not the early
    2000's where all code is white text), but also sharp and exact like a debugger such as GDB.
*/

/*
    Hope you enjoy it :}
